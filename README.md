# Terraform Commands

This repository contains a `main.tf` file that defines the resources to be created on AWS using Terraform. Below are the explanations of the Terraform commands used in this project:

## terraform init

The `terraform init` command is used to initialize a Terraform working directory. It downloads the necessary provider plugins and sets up the backend configuration. This command needs to be run once in a new Terraform project or whenever the provider or backend configuration changes.

## terraform validate

The `terraform validate` command is used to check the syntax and validate the configuration files in a Terraform project. It ensures that the configuration files are properly written and all required values are provided. This command is useful for catching errors before running any Terraform commands that could potentially create or modify resources.

## terraform plan

The `terraform plan` command is used to create an execution plan for Terraform. It shows what actions Terraform will take to create, modify, or destroy resources based on the current configuration. This command is useful for reviewing the changes that will be made before actually applying them.

## terraform apply

The `terraform apply` command is used to apply the changes defined in the Terraform configuration. It creates, modifies, or destroys resources as necessary to match the desired state defined in the configuration files. This command should be used with caution as it can make changes to your infrastructure.

## terraform destroy

The `terraform destroy` command is used to destroy all the resources created by Terraform. It reads the Terraform state and releases the resources accordingly. This command should be used with caution as it permanently deletes resources and cannot be undone.

Please refer to the `main.tf` file in this repository for the specific resource configurations used in this project.
